Social Networking System
A java based social network application created in NetBeans.
This application is intended for University students who have difficulty making friends.
Users can create an account and select their University. They are then placed in a pool with other users who attend the same University. 
Users can then take a short personality test and select a few of their interests to complete their profile. 
This information is then used to reccomend other users with the same interests who go to the same University. Users can also send friend requests
directly to other users if they know their username. 
Users who are friends can message each other.
Any user can create an event for other users who go to the same University. These events are public
and everyone who attends the school can see them.
